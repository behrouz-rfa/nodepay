# Nodepay Money Transfer System
# Overview
This system allows peer-to-peer money transfers using blockchain technology. Users can register with the system to create blockchain wallets. They can then conduct transactions with each other by transferring funds between wallets.

The transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger maintained by a decentralized network of miners. The miners validate transactions and group them into blocks using a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.



# Users
Users register with the system by creating an account secured by a password hash
Each user can have multiple blockchain wallets tied to their account
Wallets store the public wallet address and encrypted private key of the user
# Transactions
Users can transfer funds between wallets by creating transactions
Transactions include the sender wallet, recipient wallet, transfer amount and a signature
Miners verify the transaction signatures before adding transactions to the ledger
# Blocks
Validated transactions are grouped into blocks by the miners
Each block contains a timestamp, transaction list, and hashes linking it to previous blocks
Miners must solve a complex math problem to add blocks to the chain
# Blockchain
The blockchain is a distributed ledger containing all blocks connected in a chain
It uses proof-of-stake, where miners stake tokens to verify blocks
The blockchain provides an immutable record of all money transfers
# Data Storage
User account data, wallets, transactions, and blockchain data are stored securely
The storage layer has APIs for managing user accounts and retrieving blockchain data
